# Angular + Spring Boot + PostgreSQL Application

This project is a full-stack web application built using **Angular** for the frontend, **Spring Boot** for the backend, and **PostgreSQL** as the database. It integrates modern frontend and robust backend technologies to deliver a scalable and maintainable solution.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: [Angular](https://angular.io/) – A powerful framework for building dynamic and responsive user interfaces.
- **Backend**: [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) – A Java-based framework for creating standalone, production-grade backend services with minimal configuration.
- **Database**: [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) – A powerful, open-source relational database system known for reliability, scalability, and standards compliance.

## 🚀 Features

- Modular and reactive frontend with Angular components, services, and routing.
- RESTful API layer powered by Spring Boot for seamless communication between frontend and backend.
- Secure and efficient data persistence using PostgreSQL.
- Clean separation of concerns between client and server layers.
- Easily deployable and containerizable (Docker support can be added).

## 📦 Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js and npm (for Angular)
- Java 17+ (for Spring Boot)
- PostgreSQL (with a configured database)
- Maven or Gradle (depending on build setup)

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/angular-spring-boot-application.git
cd angular-spring-boot-application
```

### 2. Set Up the Backend (Spring Boot)

```bash
cd backend
# Update application.properties with your PostgreSQL credentials
# Example:
# spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/your_db
# spring.datasource.username=your_username
# spring.datasource.password=your_password

# Build and run
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

Backend will run on `http://localhost:8080`.

### 3. Set Up the Frontend (Angular)

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
ng serve
```

Frontend will be available at `http://localhost:4200`.

## 📞 API Communication

The Angular frontend communicates with the Spring Boot backend via HTTP requests to REST endpoints (e.g., `http://localhost:8080/api/...`).

## 🐳 Optional: Docker Support (Future Enhancement)

Consider containerizing the app using Docker and Docker Compose for easy deployment.
